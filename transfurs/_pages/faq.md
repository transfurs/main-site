## Ban Appeals
To appeal a ban on our discord, please reach out to the reddit moderators via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Ftransfurs) with the time and date you were banned, and the account ID you were banned under. Note that not all bans can be appealed.
## Therians/Otherkin?
These are people who identify more strongly with animals of some sort than they do human beings. Think of it like being transgender, but for your species instead!
## Plurality/Systems?
Plurality (or multiplicity) is the existence of multiple self-aware entities inside one physical brain. Think of it like a group of (often times lifelong) roommates, but its a body instead of an appartment/dorm.
## Why Do Some People Show Up as Bots/Apps?
These people are not actually bots, PluralKit, a bot designed for systems, detects messages with certain tags associated with a profile, then replaces that message under a "pseudo-account" of that profile, allowing multiple profiles under one Discord account. This bot can be useful for multiple people sharing one body (aka Plurals or Systems)!
